Baby's First Blockchain
--------
This is a simple example project intended to help solidify the concepts of a blockchain to those unfamiliar with it, as well as forcing me to get more comfortable with them by implementing a basic one.

## Running the chain
The blockchain shown here is very simple and only runs locally (dealing with consensus algs was a headache I didn't feel like getting). In order to run it, you must have Python 3 installed; that's the only requirement to run this project. Once you have verified you have the correct version of Python installed, simply run the main file and follow the prompts:

```
python3 bfbc/main.py
```

## Where to go from here
While this example project will give you a good headstart in understanding the basics of blockchain tech, there are still some missing holes. Primarily that this chain does _not_ allow outside network connections (as stated above). As such, to fully understand how most blockchain technology works, you should supplement your knowledge with reading up on the different consensus algorithms.
